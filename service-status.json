The shutdown starts with the release of v2.3.81 â€” release date is not yet decided. In older versions, the store remains accessible but may not work or may already be shut down. You can still download add-ons manually from GitHub: https://github.com/modcoretech/addons/tree/main/Add-on%20Store%20NGEM."
